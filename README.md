# My First Website

### Welcome!

This is a small project with big meaning. It required a minimum amount
of coding learnt from the HTML and CSS Fundamentals modules, a little research
and Wikipedia to inform on the technologies to be utilised throughout the 
FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPEMENT COURSE.

In addition to the above, Git and GitHub was used which was, to me, the most 
important aspect. It was not only useful to learn to use it but very important
to learn why it was necessary to use it because that is essentially what 
will 'develop the developer' in me. It made me realise that it's what web 
development is at the core...incremental development throughout the lifecycle of a 
project until it becomes a complete or finished product (as much as that is
possible.)
